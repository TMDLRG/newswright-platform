## U.S. Market Forecast (2025–2028)

| Year | Newspapers | Standalone Digital | Network Digital | TV Ops | Other | Total |
|------|------------|-------------------|-----------------|--------|-------|-------|
| 2025 | 5,419 | 695 | 853 | 695 | 992 | 8,654 |
| 2026 | 5,271 | 728 | 964 | 693 | 992 | 8,648 |
| 2027 | 5,123 | 761 | 1,075 | 691 | 992 | 8,642 |
| 2028 | 4,975 | 794 | 1,186 | 689 | 992 | 8,636 |

**Assumptions:**
- Newspaper closures: 148/year (Medill 2025 pace)
- Standalone digital growth: +33/year (Medill 2025 pace)
- Network digital growth: +111/year (Medill 2025 pace)
- TV operations: -2/year (RTDNA trend)
- Ethnic/foreign-language and public media: stable

**Interpretation:** Total units remain roughly flat (~8,600–8,650); composition shifts from print to digital. This structural shift favors NewsWright — digital-native outlets adopt SaaS tools more readily than legacy print operations.
