## Decisions Locked During Session 1

All decisions below are final and binding for Sessions 2–5. Any deviation requires explicit founder override.

| ID | Decision | Locked Value | Rationale |
|----|----------|-------------|-----------|
| **C4** | Series Seed Size | **$1.0M–$1.5M** | Bottom-up from v5.1 operating expenses (not reverse-engineered from returns). 10x return confirmed at all levels up to $1.5M. |
| **C5** | Series Seed Valuation | **$8–10M pre-money; anchor at $10M** | Implies 10–14x revenue multiple on $720K ARR at M12. Credible for vertical SaaS with strong pilot data. |
| **C6/C7** | Revenue Source of Truth | **V5.1 operating model** | M12: $60K MRR / $720K ARR. Roadmap's $200K MRR corrected to ~M18–20. Year 1 collected revenue ~$355K (back-loaded ramp). |
| **BD1** | Brand Name | **"NewsWright"** | Drop "International" from all materials. Production brand via agency during pilot ($20K budget, M4–6). |
| **BD2** | Primary Tagline | **"The Operating System for Modern Newsrooms"** | Consistent with v5.1 positioning throughout all documents. |
| **TEAM** | Team Model | **V5.1 lean model** | GM hire triggers at Gate 1 pass (M4). Denise/David compensation at 25 clients (M5). 3-dev expansion available as growth trigger at ~50 clients. |
