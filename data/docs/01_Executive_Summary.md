## The Operating System for Modern Newsrooms

**Version:** 2.0 | **Date:** February 11, 2026 | **Status:** UPDATED — Investor Ready

## THE PROBLEM

The local journalism crisis is accelerating: 148 newspapers closed in the past year, and newsroom employment fell 7% in 2024 alone. The remaining 8,654 local news operations face an impossible task — maintaining coverage with fewer people. Since 2005, more than 3,200 newspapers have closed and newsroom employment has plummeted 75% (from ~360,000 to ~91,550). Today, 208 U.S. counties have zero local news coverage, and 1,563 have only a single source.[1] The surviving newsrooms operate at 30-50% of historical staffing, with journalists covering 3-5x the beats they did a decade ago. At the same time, $500M+ in foundation funding (Press Forward, 40+ chapters) is actively seeking technology solutions that can reverse this trend.

## THE SOLUTION

NewsWright is an AI-powered editorial operating system — ServiceNow for journalism. The platform returns time to newsrooms by automating routine production work (press releases, meeting coverage, obituaries) while keeping journalists in control through human-in-the-loop approval gates. Editorial DNA training captures each newsroom's voice and standards. News Signal monitors local government and community data sources to surface story leads journalists might otherwise miss. Live testing at Racine County Eye has returned **17+ hours per journalist per month** from obituary workflows alone.
