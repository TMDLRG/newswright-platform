## Executive Summary

This operating model reflects a **lean, milestone-driven founder structure**:

1. **Michael is full-time** — Solution Architect role with founder salary

3. **Contracted PM handles pilot execution** — onboarding, cohort management, testimonials
4. **Founder compensation scales with clients** — Denise/David trigger at 25 paying clients

**Scaled Pilot Strategy:**
- 50 sites in staggered cohorts (10 → 30 → 50)
- Gate 1 at Day 90 with 50% of Year 1 target already engaged
- Conservative 58% conversion = 29 paying clients at launch

**Key Outcomes:**
- True 12+ month runway on $500K seed
- 50 sites in pilot by Day 90
- 25-40 paid conversions by M4-5
- Path to 100+ clients by Month 10 via partner channels
- Series Seed ($1.0M–$1.5M at $8–$10M pre-money) at Month 10

## Market Context

The U.S. local news market comprises 8,654 operations (Medill 2025 + RTDNA):

| Segment | Units | Share | Trend |
|---------|-------|-------|-------|
| Newspapers | 5,419 | 62.6% | Declining ~2.7%/year (-148/yr) |
| Standalone digital outlets | 695 | 8.0% | Growing ~4.8%/year (+33/yr) |
| Network digital sites | 853 | 9.9% | Growing ~13%/year (+111/yr) |
| TV stations originating local news | 695 | 8.0% | Stable (slight decline) |
| Other (ethnic, public media) | 992 | 11.5% | Stable |
| **Total** | **8,654** | **100%** | **Composition shifting to digital** |

**Core ICP:** 2,500–3,500 (independent digital + nonprofit outlets)

Our GTM prioritizes the growing digital segments while capturing newspaper market share as outlets seek efficiency tools to offset staffing declines. At target pricing ($500 blended ARPU), the U.S. unit TAM is $51.9M ARR.

### Scenario Comparison (Phase 0 Decision 0.2)

This operating model serves as the **Base Case** (source of truth per Session 1 Decision Lock). The market research ramp serves as a **Stretch Case**:

| Metric | Base Case (this model) | Stretch Case (Research) |
|--------|----------------------|------------------------|
| M12 Customers | 92 | 120 |
| M24 Customers | 338 | 550 |
| M36 Customers | 908 | 1,000 |
| M12 MRR | $60K | $60K |
| M24 MRR | $280K | $275K |
| M36 MRR | $726K | $500K |
| $6M ARR Target | ~Month 29 | ~Month 36 |

Note: Base Case achieves $6M ARR target earlier with fewer customers at higher ARPU (enterprise concentration). Stretch Case achieves broader market penetration at blended pricing.

## Team Philosophy

**Core Principles:**

1. **Michael as Solution Architect** — fills architecture, engineering leadership, product, and PM roles via AI augmentation. Full-time commitment.

2. **Denise & David are strategic advisors** — they provide strategic guidance on editorial standards and enterprise implementation. Compensation scales with revenue.

3. **Contracted PM handles pilot execution** — onboarding 50 sites requires dedicated coordination. A $55/hr PM is more cost-effective than pulling founders into logistics.

4. **AI-Augmented Development** — each developer produces 4x equivalent output. 2 devs = ~8 traditional developers.

5. **Partner distribution first** — LION (575+), INN (500), Newspack (300+) are the GTM. Paid marketing can wait.
