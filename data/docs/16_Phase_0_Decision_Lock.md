# NewsWright — Phase 0 Decision Lock Record

**Version:** 1.0 | **Date:** February 11, 2026 | **Status:** LOCKED | **Owner:** Michael Polzin

**Authorization:** Founder authorized locking research-aligned recommendations for all four decisions.

## Decision 0.1: Pricing Tier Structure

**Selected:** Option A — Adopt New Research Pricing

| Tier | Price | Seats | Target Segment |
|------|-------|-------|----------------|
| Core | $249/mo | 3 | 1–5 person outlets |
| Pro | $499/mo | 10 | Typical small newsroom |
| Premium | $749/mo | 25 | Multi-desk, automation |
| Enterprise | $1,249/mo | 60 | TV, large outlets |

**Rationale:** Research-backed tier structure from Journalism Newsroom Market Memo. Designed to achieve $500 blended ARPU with realistic tier mix: 40% Core, 35% Pro, 18% Premium, 7% Enterprise. Replaces previous $49 Starter / $149 Pro / $500–$2,500 Enterprise structure.

## Decision 0.2: Customer Acquisition Scenario

**Selected:** Option C — Present Both as Base/Stretch

| Metric | Base Case (V5.1) | Stretch Case (Market Research) |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------------------|
| M12 Customers | 92 | 120 |
| M24 Customers | 338 | 550 |
| M36 Customers | 908 | 1,000 |
| M12 MRR | $60K | $60K |
| M24 MRR | $280K | $275K |
| M36 MRR | $726K | $500K |
| $6M ARR Target | ~Month 29 | ~Month 36 |

**Rationale:** Preserves V5.1 operating model as the authoritative source of truth (per Session 1 Decision Lock), while presenting market research ramp as an upside scenario. Base Case achieves higher MRR with fewer customers (enterprise tilt, higher ARPU). Stretch Case achieves broader market penetration at blended pricing. Both converge on ~$6M ARR target.

**Note:** Base Case assumes higher ARPU with enterprise concentration. Stretch Case assumes broader market penetration at blended pricing. Both achieve $6M+ ARR target.

## Decision 0.3: U.S. Market Size Baseline

**Selected:** Adopt 8,654 units (Medill 2025 + RTDNA)

| Segment | Units | Share | Primary Source |
|---------|-------|-------|----------------|
| Newspapers | 5,419 | 62.6% | Medill 2025 |
| Standalone digital | 695 | 8.0% | Medill 2025 |
| Network digital sites | 853 | 9.9% | Medill 2025 |
| Ethnic/foreign-language | 650+ | 7.5% | Medill 2025 |
| Public media | 342 | 4.0% | Medill 2025 |
| TV originating local news | 695 | 8.0% | RTDNA 2024 |
| **Total** | **8,654** | **100%** | |

**Rationale:** Precise point estimate derived from authoritative academic/industry sources (Northwestern Medill State of Local News 2025, RTDNA/Newhouse 2024). Falls within the previously resolved ~8,500–9,000 range from Session 1. Replaces all conflicting figures (6,000+, 7,900+, 11,000) across documents.

## Decision 0.4: Blended ARPU Target

**Selected:** $500/month

**Calculation:**
- 1,000 customers × $500/mo = $500K MRR = $6.0M ARR
- Tier mix to achieve $500 ARPU: 40% Core ($249), 35% Pro ($499), 18% Premium ($749), 7% Enterprise ($1,249)
- Weighted average: (0.40 × $249) + (0.35 × $499) + (0.18 × $749) + (0.07 × $1,249) = $99.60 + $174.65 + $134.82 + $87.43 = **$496.50** + seat overages ≈ **$500**

**Rationale:** Both V5.1 model and market research converge at $500 ARPU. Clean, defensible math. Consistent with Decision 0.1 tier structure.
