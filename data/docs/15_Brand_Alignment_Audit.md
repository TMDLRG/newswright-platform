## Inconsistencies Found

| # | Document | Current Brand Usage | Issue | Resolution |
|---|----------|-------------------|-------|------------|
| 1 | `NewsWork_AI_Comprehensive_Investment_Memorandum.docx` | "NEWSWORK.AI" throughout; header, footer, contact section | Uses retired brand name | **UPDATE to NewsWright** in D1 final (Session 4). Add brand note as in v3.1 |
| 2 | `NewsWork_AI_Comprehensive_Investment_Memorandum.docx` | "orchestratelabs.com" in contact | Domain reference inconsistent with NewsWright brand | **DECISION NEEDED:** Is orchestratelabs.com the active domain? Should it reference a NewsWright domain? |
| 3 | `NewsWork_Return_Analysis_v2_1.docx` | "NewsWork.AI" in header, footer, title | Uses retired brand name | **UPDATE to NewsWright** in D5 revision (Session 2) |
| 4 | `NewsWork_Presentation.txt` | "NewsWork" (no .AI suffix) throughout transcript | Transcript is historical record; Mason heard "NewsWork" | **NO CHANGE** to transcript. Note: Mason knows the brand as "NewsWork" — follow-up materials should introduce "NewsWright" with context |
| 5 | `NewsWork_Pitch_Deck_Notes.pdf` | "NewsWork" throughout all slides | Pitch deck uses pre-stealth name | **UPDATE to NewsWright** in D2 revision (Session 4) |
| 6 | `Executive_Summary_Newswright_v2_0_docx_1.pdf` | "NewsWright International" | Adds "International" suffix not used elsewhere | **DECISION NEEDED:** Is "International" part of the stealth brand or was this a draft variant? Recommend dropping "International" for consistency unless it's the intended legal entity name |
| 7 | `Executive_Summary_Newswright_v2_0_docx_1.pdf` | "The Trust OS for Community Information" | Tagline differs from "The Operating System for Modern Newsrooms" used in all other docs | **DECISION NEEDED:** Which tagline? Recommend "The Operating System for Modern Newsrooms" for consistency; "Trust OS" could be secondary messaging |
| 8 | `NewsWright_Investment_Memorandum_v3.1.docx` | "NEWSWRIGHT" — correct | ✅ Aligned | No action needed |
| 9 | `NewsWright_Stealth_Pilot_90Day_Plan_v1.1.docx` | "NEWSWRIGHT" — correct | ✅ Aligned | No action needed |
| 10 | `NewsWright_18Month_Roadmap_v1.1.docx` | "NEWSWRIGHT" — correct | ✅ Aligned | No action needed |
| 11 | `NewsWright_Financial_Addendum_v1.1.docx` | "NEWSWRIGHT" — correct | ✅ Aligned | No action needed |
| 12 | `NewsWright_Job_Requisitions_Budget_v1.1.docx` | "NEWSWRIGHT" — correct | ✅ Aligned | No action needed |
| 13 | `NewsWright_Business_Plan_Project_Plan_v2.0.md` | Mixed: "NewsWork.AI / NewsWright" in session prompts | Transitional language for working document | **ACCEPTABLE** for internal project plan; final deliverables must use only "NewsWright" |
| 14 | `Global_Newsroom_Market_Sizing...md` | No brand name (research document) | ✅ Brand-neutral | No action needed |

---

## Tagline Variants Found

| Tagline | Used In | Recommendation |
|---------|---------|----------------|

| "The Trust OS for Community Information" | Exec Summary v2.0 | **RETIRE** or use as secondary messaging only |
| "Editorial Operating System for Local Newsrooms" | Pitch Deck | **ACCEPTABLE variant** — aligned with primary |
| "Newsroom Automation" | Investment Memo v3.1 header | **ACCEPTABLE** — category descriptor, not tagline |

---

## Domain & Contact References

| Reference | Document | Issue |
|-----------|----------|-------|
| orchestratelabs.com | Comprehensive Memo, Investment Memo v3.1 | Need to confirm this is the active investor-facing domain |
| mpolzin@zimpzap.com | Exec Summary v2.0 | Personal email — should this be a company domain? |
