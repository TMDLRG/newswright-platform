## Critical Conflicts (🔴)

### C1 — US Market Size: Outlet Count Varies Widely — ✅ RESOLVED

**Resolution:** **8,654 U.S. local news operations** (Phase 0 Decision 0.3; Medill 2025 + RTDNA 2024)

| Segment | Units | Share | Source |
|---------|-------|-------|--------|
| Newspapers | 5,419 | 62.6% | Medill 2025 |
| Standalone digital | 695 | 8.0% | Medill 2025 |
| Network digital sites | 853 | 9.9% | Medill 2025 |
| Ethnic/foreign-language | 650+ | 7.5% | Medill 2025 |
| Public media | 342 | 4.0% | Medill 2025 |
| TV originating local news | 695 | 8.0% | RTDNA 2024 |
| **Total** | **8,654** | **100%** | |

**Core ICP (indie digital + nonprofit):** 2,500–3,500

All prior figures (6,000+, 7,900+, 8,500–9,000, 11,000) are retired. Use 8,654 exclusively across all documents.

---

### C2 — Newspapers Closed Since 2005 — ✅ RESOLVED

**Resolution:** **3,200+ newspapers closed since 2005** (Medill 2025). Annual closure rate: 148/year (~2.7%). Use consistently across all documents. Drop "2,900+" from Investment Memo.

---

### C3 — Journalism Jobs Lost — ✅ RESOLVED

**Resolution:** Use: **"Newsroom employment has declined 75% from its 2005 peak of ~360,000 to ~91,550 in 2024, a 7% year-over-year decline"** (Medill 2025). Drop the "43,000+ jobs eliminated" figure entirely — it referenced a different metric/timeframe and is misleading.

---

### C4 — Series Seed Round Size — ✅ RESOLVED (Session 1 LOCKED)

**Resolution:** **$1.0M–$1.5M** at **$8–$10M pre-money; anchor at $10M**. Bottom-up from V5.1 operating expenses. 10x return confirmed at all levels up to $1.5M. Replaces both the $1.5–2.5M and $2.5–4M figures from earlier documents.

---

### C5 — Series Seed Pre-Money Valuation — ✅ RESOLVED (Session 1 LOCKED)

**Resolution:** **$8–$10M pre-money; anchor at $10M** for Series Seed. Implies 10–14x revenue multiple on $720K ARR at M12.

The $60–$90M figure is the **post-traction exit valuation** (Year 3+ at 10x–15x on $6M ARR), NOT the Series Seed valuation. These must be clearly differentiated in all documents:
- **Seed (now):** $4.5–$5M pre-money
- **Series Seed (M10):** $8–$10M pre-money
- **Exit (Year 3+):** $60M+ at 10x ARR

See Valuation_Narrative.md for full framing.

---

### C6 — Revenue at End of Seed Capital ($500K) — ✅ RESOLVED (Session 1 LOCKED)

**Resolution:** **V5.1 Operating Model is the source of truth** for all revenue projections:
- M12: $60K MRR / $720K ARR (92 customers)
- Collected revenue in first 12 months: ~$355K (back-loaded ramp)
- The Roadmap's $200K MRR figure is corrected to ~M18–20 timeframe
- Year 1 "$900K ARR" from Comprehensive Memo is retired; use V5.1 figures

---

## Important Conflicts (🟡)

### C7 — 18-Month Roadmap MRR Targets vs. Annual Revenue Projections — ✅ CLOSED

**Issue:** Roadmap showed $200K MRR at M12 vs. V5.1's $60K MRR at M12.

**Resolution (Decision Handoff v1.0):** V5.1 Operating Model is source of truth. M12 MRR = **$60,000** (not $200K). The $200K MRR figure targets ~M18–20. Roadmap v3.0 corrected with explicit note: "CRITICAL CORRECTION: M12 MRR = $60,000 (not $200K from prior versions)." V5.1 customer progression:

| Month | Clients | MRR |
|-------|---------|-----|
| M6 | 35 | $34,000 |
| M12 | 92 | $60,000 |
| M18 | 176 | $102,000 |
| M24 | 338 | $280,000 |

---

### C8 — Gate Structure Timing — ✅ CLOSED

**Issue:** Gate numbering differed across Comprehensive Memo, Investment Memo, and Pilot Plan.

**Resolution (Decision Handoff v1.0):** Standardized gate structure per V5.1:
- **Gate 0:** Pre-pilot (10 LOIs confirmed, platform deployed)
- **Gate 1:** Day 90 — Stealth Pilot exit / GO-NO-GO
- Phase 1 exit: M6 (pilot conversions complete)
- Phase 2 exit: M12 (Series Seed closed)

Applied in: Pilot Plan v3.0, 18-Month Roadmap v3.0.

---

### C9 — Pilot Outcome Count — ✅ CLOSED

**Issue:** Comprehensive Memo showed 3 outcomes; Pilot Plan showed 4 (adding "Production Brand Ready").

**Resolution (Decision Handoff v1.0):** Use **PROVE framework criteria** as the standard. **No branding gate** at Gate 1. Branding budget ($20,000) allocated M4–M6 post-Gate 1. Applied in: Pilot Plan v3.0 (PROVE framework with 6 criteria, no branding gate).

---

### C10 — Customer Count Progression — ✅ CLOSED

**Issue:** Customer counts differed across Comprehensive Memo, Return Analysis, and Roadmap.

**Resolution (Decision Handoff v1.0):** V5.1 Operating Model customer progression is authoritative:
- M3: 50 pilot sites (0 paying)
- M4: 7 paying
- M6: 35 paying
- M12: 92 paying
- M15: 140 (break-even)
- M18: 197
- M24: 338
- M36: 908 (Base Case) / 1,000 (Stretch Case)

Applied in: Roadmap v3.0, Exec Summary v2.0, Return Analysis v4.0, Financial Addendum v3.0.

---

### C11 — Exec Summary v2.0 Milestones Differ from Other Docs — ✅ CLOSED

**Issue:** Original Exec Summary v2.0 (.docx) referenced SOC 2 readiness, 50–100 newsrooms, and $2M Series A at Q3 2026.

**Resolution (Decision Handoff v1.0):** Exec Summary aligned to V5.1 framework. New D3_Executive_Summary_v2.md created with correct figures: 50 pilot sites, Series Seed $1.0–$1.5M at $8–$10M (not "Series A $2M"), V5.1 customer progression, dual Base/Stretch scenarios.

---

## Minor Conflicts (🟢)

### C12 — Hours Contributed by Founders vs. Contracted — ✅ CLOSED

**Issue:** Comprehensive Memo showed 241 founder hours; Job Reqs showed 585 (390 + 65 + 130).

**Resolution (Decision Handoff v1.0):** **Job Reqs v2.0 is authoritative.** Founder hours = **585 total** (Michael 390 + Denise 65 + David 130). The 241 figure reflected an earlier allocation. Master Assumptions Log G10 updated.

---

### C13 — Contracted Resource Line Item Math

| Component | Job Reqs Subtotal | Financial Addendum |
|-----------|-------------------|--------------------|
| PM ($24,375) + Liaison ($13,000) + Sr Dev ($68,250) + Mid Dev ($40,625) | $146,250 | $165,548 |
| Difference | — | $19,298 (labeled "Onboarding & Knowledge Transfer") |

**Resolution:** ✅ Not a conflict — the $19,298 gap is explicitly labeled in Job Reqs v1.1. Sums are correct.

---

### C14 — Founder Compensation Detail

| Financial Addendum v1.1 | Job Reqs v1.1 | Match? |
|--------------------------|---------------|--------|
| Michael: $15K/mo = $45K | $45,000 ($115/hr × 390 hrs) | ✅ Hourly implies higher |
| Denise: $2.2K/mo = $6.6K | $6,500 ($100/hr × 65 hrs) | ⚠️ Close but $100 off |
| David: $3.7K/mo = $11.1K | $11,050 ($85/hr × 130 hrs) | ⚠️ Close but $50 off |
| Benefits: included | $9,300 | ✅ Accounts for difference |

**Resolution:** Close enough — the minor differences are absorbed by the benefits/taxes allowance. No action needed.

---

### C15 — Development Approach Comparison Numbers

| Document | Traditional Path | AI + ORCHESTRATE Path | Savings |
|----------|------------------|-----------------------|---------|
| Comprehensive Memo | 14 months / $1,072,000 | 6.5 months / $497,000 | 54% ($575,000) |
| Investment Memo v3.1 | Same | Same | Same |

**Resolution:** ✅ Consistent across docs. No conflict.

---

---

## New Conflicts (Phase 0 Update Cycle)

### C16 — Pricing Tiers Differ Across Docs — ✅ CLOSED

**Issue:** Phase 0 Decision 0.1 adopted new pricing ($249/$499/$749/$1,249). Existing documents showed $49 Starter / $149 Pro / $500–$2,500 Enterprise.

**Resolution:** Decision 0.1 pricing applied to all updated documents (Phases 2–6). Verified in Phase 7 QA: $249 Core tier appears in 13 .md files. No updated documents contain old $49/$149/$2,500 pricing.

---

### C17 — Customer Ramp: Dual Scenario (Base vs Stretch) — ✅ CLOSED

**Issue:** Phase 0 Decision 0.2 adopted Option C (present both V5.1 Base Case and market research Stretch Case).

| Metric | Base Case (V5.1) | Stretch Case (Research) |
|--------|-------------------|------------------------|
| M12 Customers | 92 | 120 |
| M24 Customers | 338 | 550 |
| M36 Customers | 908 | 1,000 |

**Resolution:** Dual scenario tables added to: Financial Model Addendum v3, Return Analysis v4, Operating Model v5.2, Executive Summary v2, Phase 0 Decision Lock Record. All documents clearly label Base vs Stretch scenarios.

---

## Summary

| Severity | Count | Status |
|----------|-------|--------|
| 🔴 Critical (C1–C6) | 6 | **All CLOSED** (Session 1 + Phase 0 locks) |
| 🟡 Important (C7–C11) | 5 | **All CLOSED** (Decision Handoff v1.0 + V5.1 SOT) |
| 🟢 Minor (C12–C15) | 4 | **C12 CLOSED** (Handoff); C13–C15 confirmed no action needed |
| ✅ New (C16–C17) | 2 | **All CLOSED** (Phase 0 pricing + scenarios applied) |
| **Total** | **17** | **All 17 resolved — 13 formally closed, 4 confirmed non-issues** |
