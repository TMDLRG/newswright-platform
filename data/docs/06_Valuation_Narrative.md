# Valuation Narrative
## NewsWright — Bridging Seed Valuation to Exit Valuation

**Version:** 1.1 | **Date:** February 11, 2026 | **Status:** UPDATED — Session 1 + Phase 0 Decisions Applied

## Investor-Ready Paragraph (Use in Memo, Deck Notes, and Verbal)

NewsWright is raising $500K at a pre-money valuation of $4.5M–$5.0M, giving the seed investor approximately 9–10% ownership post-money. This reflects an early-stage, pre-revenue valuation consistent with AI-native vertical SaaS companies that have a completed MVP, a live testbed with measured ROI, and a defined go-to-market path. As the company scales through pilot validation, paid customer conversion, and international expansion, we project Year 3 ARR of $6M+ across four revenue streams. At that milestone, comparable AI-native vertical SaaS companies trade at 10x–15x ARR, implying a company valuation of $60M–$90M. Accounting for approximately 15% dilution from a Series Seed round at Month 9–12, the seed investor's ownership adjusts to ~8–8.5%, yielding a baseline return of approximately 10x on the initial $500K investment at a Year 3 exit—meeting the standard venture return threshold. A Year 5 exit at $10M–$12M ARR would yield 16–23x returns, rewarding patient capital with additional upside from international expansion.

## Supporting Math (Show Your Work)

### Step 1: Seed Entry

| Variable | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Seed Investment | $500,000 |
| Pre-Money Valuation | $4.5M–$5.0M |
| Post-Money Valuation | $5.0M–$5.5M |
| Seed Investor Ownership | $500K ÷ $5.0M = **10.0%** (low end) to $500K ÷ $5.5M = **9.1%** (high end) |

### Step 2: Series Seed Dilution

| Variable | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Series Seed Target | **$1.0M–$1.5M** (Session 1 Lock) |
| Series Seed Pre-Money | **$8M–$10M; anchor $10M** (Session 1 Lock) |
| Series Seed Dilution to Existing | ~11.1%–13.0% |
| Seed Investor Post-Dilution | 10.0% × 0.87 = **8.7%** (Stretch) to 10.0% × 0.889 = **8.9%** (Minimum) |
| **Working assumption:** | **~8.7%–8.9%** post-dilution |

### Step 3: Year 3 Exit (Base Case)

| Variable | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Year 3 ARR | $6,000,000 |
| Exit Multiple | 10x ARR |
| Exit Valuation | $60,000,000 |
| Seed Investor Share (~8.7%) | $60M × 0.087 = **$5,220,000** |
| Return Multiple | $5.22M ÷ $500K = **10.4x** |
| Seed Investor Share (~8.9%) | $60M × 0.089 = **$5,340,000** |
| Return Multiple | $5.34M ÷ $500K = **10.7x** |

**Conclusion:** At ~8.7–8.9% post-dilution ownership, a $60M exit yields **10.4x–10.7x** — comfortably crossing the 10x threshold.

**Market Context:** The $6M ARR target represents 11.6% penetration of 8,654 U.S. local news operations (Medill 2025 + RTDNA), or ~1,000 paying customers at $500 blended monthly ARPU.

### Step 4: Year 5 Exit (Base Case)

| Variable | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Year 5 ARR | $10,000,000 |
| Exit Multiple | 10x ARR |
| Exit Valuation | $100,000,000 |
| Seed Investor Share (~8.0%) | $100M × 0.08 = **$8,000,000** |
| Return Multiple | $8.0M ÷ $500K = **16.0x** |

## Why $4.5M–$5M Now and $60M–$90M Later Are Both Correct

These are **not competing valuations**. They describe different points on the same growth curve:

| Stage | Valuation | Basis | Evidence |
|-------|-----------|-------|----------|
| **Seed (Today)** | $4.5M–$5.0M | MVP value ($425K) + team + methodology + market timing | Pre-revenue; completed product; live testbed |
| **Series Seed (Month 9–12)** | $8M–$12M | Pilot validation + paid customers + pipeline | Post-pilot revenue traction |
| **Year 3 Exit** | $60M–$90M | 10x–15x on $6M+ ARR | Comparable AI-native vertical SaaS multiples |

The seed investor enters at the earliest, highest-risk point and is compensated with the lowest entry price. Each subsequent funding event re-prices the company based on de-risked milestones.

## Sensitivity: What Changes the Answer?

| If This Changes... | Return Impact |
|--------------------|---------------|
| Year 3 ARR drops to $4M (33% miss) | Exit = $40M → Return = **6.4x** (below threshold) |
| Year 3 ARR drops to $5M (17% miss) | Exit = $50M → Return = **8.0x** (close but below) |
| Exit multiple drops to 8x (market contraction) | Exit = $48M → Return = **7.7x** |
| Series Seed dilutes to 20% instead of 15% | Post-dilution = ~7.3% → Return at $60M = **8.8x** |
| Both: $5M ARR + 8x multiple | Exit = $40M at 7.3% = **5.8x** |

**Key insight for investors:** The 10x return requires either (a) hitting $6M ARR at 10x multiple, or (b) exceeding on one variable to compensate for the other. The pilot phase validates the two most sensitive inputs: customer acquisition rate and willingness-to-pay.

## Comparable Transactions (for Exit Multiple Justification)

The 10x–15x ARR multiple for AI-native vertical SaaS is supported by:

- **Automattic ecosystem acquisitions:** Parse.ly ($100M+), WooCommerce (~$30M), Pocket Casts (~$20M) — all WordPress/publisher-adjacent
- **Vertical SaaS AI benchmarks:** Companies with 75%+ gross margins, $5M–$15M ARR, and large TAMs typically trade at 8x–15x ARR in M&A
- **Strategic premium:** NewsWright's unique positioning in journalism ethics + AI governance commands a premium from mission-aligned acquirers
