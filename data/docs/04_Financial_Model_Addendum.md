| Seed Round | $500,000 |
| Pre-Money Valuation (Seed) | $4.5M–$5.0M |
| Seed Investor Ownership | ~10% |

## 2. Pricing Tier Structure

Per Phase 0 Decision 0.1 (Option A — Research-Backed Pricing):

| Tier | Price | Seats | Target Segment |
|------|-------|-------|----------------|
| Core | $249/mo | 3 | 1–5 person outlets |
| Pro | $499/mo | 10 | Typical small newsroom |
| Premium | $749/mo | 25 | Multi-desk, automation |
| Enterprise | $1,249/mo | 60 | TV, large outlets |

### Tier Distribution at Scale (Month 36 — Stretch Case)

To achieve $500 blended MRR across 1,000 customers:

| Tier | Price | Customers | % Mix | MRR Contribution |
|------|-------|-----------|-------|------------------|
| Core | $249 | 395 | 39.5% | $98,355 |
| Pro | $499 | 350 | 35.0% | $174,650 |
| Premium | $749 | 185 | 18.5% | $138,565 |
| Enterprise | $1,249 | 70 | 7.0% | $87,430 |
| **Total** | **$500 avg** | **1,000** | **100%** | **$499,000** |

Seat overages and add-ons contribute additional ~$1K MRR to reach $500K target.

## 3. Use of Funds — Seed Round ($500K)

The $500K seed round funds a 90-day scaled pilot (50 sites) and operations through Month 9, when Series Seed capital is raised. Revenue from pilot conversions (M4–M6) and partner channel (M7–M9) extends runway.

| Category | Amount | % of Seed |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| Pilot Team (M1–3) | $129,189 | 25.8% |
| Pilot Operations (M1–3) | $11,100 | 2.2% |
| Post-Pilot Team (M4–9) | $433,680 | 86.7% |
| Post-Pilot Operations (M4–9) | $63,602 | 12.7% |
| Risk Reserve (10% of pilot) | $14,029 | 2.8% |
| Less: Revenue (M4–9) | ($196,125) | — |
| **NET USE OF FUNDS** | **$455,475** | **91.1%** |

Note: Post-Pilot Operations includes branding company engagement ($20K allocated across M4–M6).

| M36 | 1,000 | $500,000 | $6.0M |

### 5.3 Scenario Summary

| Metric | Base Case (V5.1) | Stretch Case (Research) |
|--------|-------------------|------------------------|
| M12 Customers | 92 | 120 |
| M24 Customers | 338 | 550 |
| M36 Customers | 908 | 1,000 |

| M36 MRR | $726K | $500K |
| $6M ARR Achieved | ~Month 29 | ~Month 36 |

**Note:** Base Case assumes higher ARPU with enterprise concentration. Stretch Case assumes broader market penetration at blended pricing. Both achieve $6M+ ARR target.

## 6. Market Penetration Analysis

**U.S. Local News Operations:** 8,654 (Medill 2025 + RTDNA 2024)

| Milestone | Customers | % of 8,654 | Case |
|-----------|-----------|------------|------|
| M6 (Pilot conversions) | 35 | 0.4% | Both |
| M12 (Year 1) | 92–120 | 1.1–1.4% | Base/Stretch |
| M24 (Year 2) | 338–550 | 3.9–6.4% | Base/Stretch |
| M36 (Year 3) | 908–1,000 | 10.5–11.6% | Base/Stretch |

**U.S. TAM at Target Pricing:** 8,654 × $500/mo × 12 = **$51.9M ARR**

Year 3 target of $6M ARR represents 11.6% of U.S. unit TAM — a credible penetration rate for a vertical SaaS leader in Year 3.
