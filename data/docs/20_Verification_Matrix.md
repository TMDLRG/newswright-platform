| Old Figure | Context Where Still Appears | Acceptable? |
|------------|---------------------------|-------------|

| "$49 Starter / $149 Pro / $2,500 Enterprise" | Conflict Register (noting old values); Phase 0 Lock (noting replacement); Pitch Deck Edit List (marking for update); S1 note "replaces former $49 Starter" | ✅ Reference only |
| "~11,000" radio stations | S1 F19 — radio stations are a separate category (not market size) | ✅ Correct usage |
| "$350–$500/month" | D9 v1.0 (.docx, not updated); D9 v2.0 uses $249–$1,249 | ✅ Old .docx superseded |

**Result: No updated documents contain old/conflicting figures as current values.**
